<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

This repository contains the code for my bachelors thesis at University of Bielefeld in the winter semester 22/23. <br />
The topic is: *"Entwicklung von Visualisierungswerkzeugen zur Auswertung von VR-Navigationsexperimenten beim Menschen"*(Development of visualization tools that can be used to evaluate vr-navigation-experiments performed by humans).

More precisely the task was to find ways of visualizing "meta-data" that humans might use when navigating through a vr-world. This "meta-data" includes things such as how the environment moves in respect to oneself or how sharp/blurry one perceives parts of the environment. <br />
The task also included...\TODO

*Why is it relevant to be able to have such tools?*
\TODO

<br />

The vr-experiments are designed and performed with Unity, thus all the evaluation tools are also made with Unity.

<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
## Getting Started

This repository basically consist of two parts. 
* The first part is a *folder* called *visu-tools*. This folder can be opened via Unity and contains the whole unity project in which the task got implemented. It serves as an example showcasing the tools. From here on this part will be referenced by *visu-tools project*.
* The second part is a *.unitypackage* file called *visu-tools*. As the file ending suggest this file is a unity package and can be imported as such into a unity project. This package only contains the tools themselves, how they get incorporated into any given project is left to the user. As described above, *visu-tools project* serves as an example how one can incorporate them. From here on this part will be referenced by *visu-tools package*.

### Prerequisites
Everything got implemented and tested using the Unity editor version *2021.3.12f1* and a simple 3D core project base using the *built-in render pipeline*. <br />
XR support got tested using the Mock HMD Loader. Both render modes (multi pass, single pass instanced) were tested and functioning. <br />
If anything does not work for you, be sure to check if your set-up is any different. Especially other render pipelines might have problems!

### Installation

#### *Visu-tools project*
1. Clone or download this repository.
2. Open Unity hub on your computer.
3. Make sure you  have  Unity editor version *2021.3.12f1* installed.
4. Under *Projects* click *Open > Add project from disk* and select the folder named *visu-tools* contained in the just cloned/downloaded repository.
5. The Unity editor should now open up the project.

#### *Visu-tools package*
1. Clone or download this repository.
2. Open up the Unity project in which you want to incorporate the package. Make sure this project fulfills the <a href="#prerequisites">prerequisites</a>. You can try to use a different set-up, however, it is not guaranteed that the tools still work as expected. 
3. Open the folder containing the  just cloned/downloaded repository.
4. Move the *.unitypackage* file in your Unity Editor. An import dialogue will appear. Imported all the files.
5. You can see the files in your project tab under *Assets > visu-tools*.

<!-- USAGE -->
## Usage

The usage differs between just using the example *visu-tools project* or incorporating the *visu-tools package* into another project. The following describes both cases. It is assumed that you completed the <a href="#installation">installation</a> and are familiar with the Unity editor.

### Visu-tools project
The project contains four different scenes: *Main Menu, Test World, Record World, Replay World*. <br />
Open up the *Main Menu* scene and enter play mode. Now you can navigate between the different scenes. 

#### *Test World*
Here you can use your keyboard (W,A,S,D) and mouse to navigate your character in first person mode through an example environment. <br />
In order to spicy things up do the following:
1. If you use play mode in full screen mode, don't.
2. In the hierarchy go to *Player > Main Camera*.
3. In the inspector go to *Control Shader (Script)*.
4. Under *Shader active* you can now select which visualization tool should be applied to your image. What the different effects do and how they work is explained here: <a href="#technical-background">Technical background</a>. However, you do not need this knowledge in order to just play around.
5. Go move around and see what happens!

#### *Record World*
Here you can use your keyboard (W,A,S,D) and mouse to navigate your character in first person mode through an example environment. <br />
By pressing the *RECORD* button in the graphical interface you start recording your movement. By pressing the *STOP* button in the graphical interface you stop recording your movement. <br />
Your movement information will be saved and can be replayed in the *Replay World* scene.

#### *Replay World*
Here you cannot move on your own. <br />
There are a few buttons you can use (some might only appear if certain other buttons got pressed, but it's pretty self explanatory):
* *PlAY*: Starts the replay of your previously recorded movement. 
* *PAUSE*: Pauses the replay.
* *RESUME*: Resumes the replay.
* *STOP*: Stops the replay.
While the replay is playing you can try using different visualization effects as described here: <a href="#test-world">test world</a>. Because of the replay function you do not have to switch between the in inspector and game view in order to try out the effects!

/TODO: Bilder, gui back knÃ¶pfe, gui shader, gui file selection


### Visu-tools package
The package contains a view different folders filled with scripts, matrials and other information in order to make everything work. Feel free to go through it and, if necessary, modify it for your needs.

#### *Visualization effects function*
In the following the different parts contributing to the visualization effects function will be listed. 
* *visu-tools > Editor > ControlShaderEditor* : Controls how the inspector for the ControlShader script looks. 
* *visu-tools > materials* : Contains three different materials that all use a different shader. 
* *visu-tools > Visualization Scripts* : Contains four different scripts. Three of them, *Depth, ImageFilter, MotionField*, are classes with the necessary methods to use/apply the corresponding shader. The fourth file, _ControlShader_, is "the heart". It is derived from mono-behaviour and delegates the task of rendering the image with the correct post-processing effect on it. 
* *visu-tools > Shader* : Contains four files. Three of them are shader files and one of them is a shader include file. The shader files contain a shader with only one subshader, but multiple passes that use different fragment shaders.

The only part important for the basic usage is the *ControlShader* script. (The other parts require at least some knowledge about applying full screen post-processing shaders in Unity. Refer to the Unity manual for information on that topic.) **The visualization effects function is now added to your project as follows:**
1. In the hierarchy click on the camera object to which you want apply the post-processing visualization effects.
2. In the inspector go to *Add Component* and type *ControlShader*. Add the *ControlShader* C# script to your camera.
3. In the inspector open up the *Set-up* part of the *ControlShader* script. The materials should already be moved in there (if not, please do so); the camera should be empty. In this empty camera field move your camera object (the same object where you added the script as a component, not a different one!).
4. You're all set up! You can now control the applied effect using the *Shader Active* selection on the script in the inspector. Be sure to read the tool tips when it comes to the additional settings. If you want the user to be able to control the effects in the end themselves, you have to implement a gui for that.
