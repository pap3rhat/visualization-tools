<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

This repository contains the code for my bachelors thesis at University of Bielefeld in the winter semester 22/23. <br />
The topic is: *"Entwicklung von Visualisierungswerkzeugen zur Auswertung von VR-Navigationsexperimenten beim Menschen"*(Development of visualization tools that can be used to evaluate vr-navigation-experiments performed by humans).

More precisely the task was to find ways of visualizing "meta-data" that humans might use when navigating through a VR-world. This "meta-data" includes things such as how the environment moves in respect to oneself or how sharp/blurry one perceives parts of the environment. <br />
The task also included creating a system to replay .CSV files that contain movement (position + orientation) data. In order to always have access to such files this project also contains recorder. <br />
Furthermore this project contains a function to save the motion vectors texture and the depth texture as images (.png). This is useful for analyzing the individual vectors for every frame.

*Why is it relevant to be able to have such tools?*
\TODO

<br />

TheVRr-experiments are designed and performed with Unity, thus all the evaluation tools are also made with Unity.

<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
## Getting Started

This repository basically consist of three parts. 
* The first part is a *folder* called *visu-tools*. This folder can be opened via Unity and contains the whole unity project in which the task got implemented. It serves as an example showcasing the tools. From here on this part will be referenced by *visu-tools project*.
* The second part is a *.unitypackage* file called *visu-tools*. As the file ending suggest this file is a unity package and can be imported as such into a unity project. This package only contains the tools themselves, how they get incorporated into any given project is left to the user. As described above, *visu-tools project* serves as an example how one can incorporate them. From here on this part will be referenced by *visu-tools package*.
* The third part is a *folder* called *build-visu-tools*. This folder contains a *.exe* file called *visu-tools*. This file is the finished build of the *visu-tools project* and can be explored without the Unity editor and any knowledge about it (just double left-click it). As it is basically the same as the *visu-tools project* everything non Unity editor related that applies to *visu-tools project* also applies to this build. Thus it will not be mentioned individually from here on.

### Prerequisites
Everything got implemented and tested using the Unity editor version *2021.3.12f1* and a simple 3D core project base using the *built-in render pipeline*. <br />
XR support got tested using the Mock HMD Loader inside the Editor(!). Both render modes (multi pass, single pass instanced) were tested and functioning. The GUI elements in *visu-tools project* might not work with XR, however, as *visu-tools project* only shows an example usage, that is fine. <br />
If anything does not work for you, be sure to check if your set-up is any different. Especially other render pipelines might have problems!

<!-- USAGE -->
## Usage

The usage differs between just using the example *visu-tools project* or incorporating the *visu-tools package* into another project. The following describes both cases. It is assumed that you completed the <a href="#installation">installation</a> and are familiar with the Unity editor (or are simply using the finished build).

### Visu-tools project
The project contains five different scenes: *Main Menu, Replay Menu, Test World, Record World, Replay World*. <br />
Open up the *Main Menu* scene and enter play mode. Now you can navigate between the different scenes. 

#### *Test World*
Here you can use your keyboard (W,A,S,D) and mouse to navigate your character in first person mode through an example environment. <br />
In order to spice things up you can either explore the *Options* menu, which is accessed via the *OPTIONS* button on the top-left, or do the following:
1. If you use play mode in full screen mode, don't.
2. In the hierarchy go to *Player > Main Camera*.
3. In the inspector go to *Control Shader (Script)*.
4. Under *Shader active* you can now select which visualization tool should be applied to your image. What the different effects do and how they work is explained here: <a href="#technical-background">Technical background</a>. However, you do not need this knowledge in order to just play around.
5. Go move around and see what happens!

#### *Record World*
Here you can use your keyboard (W,A,S,D) and mouse to navigate your character in first person mode through an example environment. <br />
By pressing the *START* button in the graphical interface you start recording your movement. By pressing the *STOP* button in the graphical interface you stop recording your movement. <br />
From the moment you press *START* to the moment you press *STOP* your movement information will be saved and can be later replayed in the *Replay World* scene. <br />

#### *Replay Menu*
Here you can simply select which file should be replayed. Select the file you want, then press *REPLAY*.

#### *Replay World*
Here you cannot move on your own. <br />
On the top right there are a few replay management buttons you can use (some might only appear if certain other buttons got pressed, but it's pretty self explanatory):
* *PLAY*: Starts the replay of your previously recorded movement. 
* *PAUSE*: Pauses the replay.
* *RESUME*: Resumes the replay.
* *STOP*: Stops the replay.
While the replay is playing you can try using different visualization effects as described here: <a href="#test-world">Test world</a>.

### Visu-tools package
The package contains a view different folders filled with scripts, materials and other information in order to make everything work. Feel free to go through it and, if necessary, modify it for your needs.

#### *Visualization effects function*
In the following the different parts contributing to the visualization effects function will be listed. 
* *visu-tools > Editor > ControlShaderEditor* : Controls how the inspector for the ControlShader script looks. 
* *visu-tools > materials > Visualization Materials* : Contains three different materials that all use a different shader. 
* *visu-tools > Scripts > Visualization Scripts* : Contains four different scripts. Three of them, *Depth, ImageFilter, MotionField*, are classes with the necessary methods to use/apply the corresponding shader. The fourth file, _ControlShader_, is "the heart". It is derived from mono-behaviour and delegates the task of rendering the image with the correct post-processing effect on it. 
* *visu-tools > Shader > Visualization Shader* : Contains four files. Three of them are shader files and one of them is a shader include file. The shader files contain a shader with only one subshader, but multiple passes that use different fragment shaders.

The only part important for the **basic usage** is the *ControlShader* script. (The other parts require at least some knowledge about applying full screen post-processing shaders in Unity. Refer to the Unity manual for information on that topic.) **The visualization effects function is now added to your project as follows:**
1. In the hierarchy click on the camera object to which you want apply the post-processing visualization effects.
2. In the inspector go to *Add Component* and type *ControlShader*. Add the *ControlShader* C# script to your camera.
3. In the inspector open up the *Set-up* part of the *ControlShader* script. The materials should already be moved in there (if not, please do so); the camera should be empty. In this empty camera field move your camera object (the same object where you added the script as a component).
4. You're all set up! You can now control the applied effect using the *Shader Active* selection on the script in the inspector. Be sure to read the tool tips when it comes to the additional settings and check out the <a href="#technical-background">technical background</a> section. If you want the user to be able to control the effects themselves in the end, you have to implement a GUI for that.  

#### *Replay function*
In the following the different parts contributing to the replay function will be listed.
* *visu-tool > Scriptable Objects > Active File* : Scriptable object that holds information about the active file (i.e. the file that should be replayed). It stores the index of the file, the file name, as well as the positions and rotations for every frame (each stored in a list).
* *visu-tools > Scriptable Objects > File List* : Scriptable object that holds a list of all available file-paths, as well as the active file name and number.
* *visu-tools > Scripts > Replay Scripts*: Contains five different scripts. Two of which belong to the scriptable objects (*ActiveFile, FileList*). The other three are there to record, read and replay CSV files. 

For the **basic usage** the record, read and replay file have to be used as follows. <br />

*CSVRecorder*:
1. Attach the *CSVRecorder* file to any GameObject in the scene where the movement recording (of, for example, the player) should happen.
2. In the inspector move the GameObject, whose movement should be recorded, inside the *Recorde* slot of the script.
3. In the inspector you might write a _full_ path inside the *File Path* slot of the script. *File Path/LogFiles* is where the recorded CSV files will get saved to in this case. You can also leave this path empty. In that case the files will get saved to *Application.persistentDataPath/LogFiles*. 
4. In order to start the recording, call the *StartRecording* method of the script from anywhere you want.
5. In order to stop recording, call the *StopRecording* method of the script from anywhere you want.

**Important addition**: This recorder only saves the movement within *FixedUpdate* and **not** within *Update*. So it does not save the position and rotation of *every* frame. However, this makes it frame-rate independent, which is very important for replaying it at the same speed as recording it!

*CSVReader*:
1. In another script (eg one that controls the gui) create an Instance of the *CSVReader* script. Provide the constructor with the *Active File* and *File List* scriptable objects in the folder *visu-tools > Scriptable Objects*. You might additionally provide the constructor with a file path from where the CSV files should be read. If you don't, *Application.persistentDataPath/LogFiles* will be used as a default. In either case make sure only CSV files containing movement information are saved at that location.
2. In order to load all the CSV files that exist in the given location, call *LoadAllFiles*. This method fills the *File List* paths list with all the paths of avilable CSV files. As arguments this methods takes two boolean values. The first one (*setFirst*) determines whether the first found file will be set as the active file and the second one (*readFirst*) determines whether the information of the first file should be processed as well (and set in the *Active File* scriptable object). As a default both those values are true. Setting *readFirst* to true only makes sense if *setFirst* is set to true as well.
3. In order to set a file as the active file, call *SetActiveFile*. This method requires the index of the file within the paths list in the *File List* scriptable object. It also requires a bool (*read*) that determines whether or not the information of this file should be processed and saved as well.
4. In order to read the information contained in the file given by the *Active File* scriptable object, call *ReadActiveFile*. This method has no arguments. It reads in the position and rotation information and saves them to the corresponding lists of the *Active File* scriptable object. 

**Important addition**: In order for the information of the active file to be processed correctly, the CSV file **has to** have the following columns (that are also called that way!): *pos_x, pos_y, pos_z, quat_x, quat_y, quat_z, quat_w*. Their meaning is self-explanatory.

*CSVPlayer*:
1. Attach the *CSVPlayer* file to any GameObject in the scene that should be moved according to the CSV file, whose information is stored in the *Active File* scriptable object.
2. In the inspector move the *Active File* scriptable object from the *Scriptable Objects* folder inside the *Active File* slot of the script.
3. Calling the *StartReplay* method from anywhere causes the replay to start. The GameObject on which the script is attached will start to move according to the *Active File* scriptable object.
4. Calling the *PauseReplay* method from anywhere causes the replay to pause. The GameObject on which the script is attached will stop moving and stay at its current position.
5. Calling the *ResumeReplay* method from anywhere causes the replay to resume. The GameObject on which the script is attached will continue moving from where it paused.
6. Calling the *StopReplay* method from anywhere causes the replay to stop. The GameObject on which the script is attached will stop moving. If the replay gets started again it will start moving from the beginning (not the position where it is at at the moment of pausing).
7. Calling the *CheckRunning* method will return true if the replay has been started and not all movements have been replayed yet (it will also return true while the replay is paused!).

**Important addition**: This player updates the position and orientation of the GameObject within *FixedUpdate* and **not** within *Update*. So it does not change the position and rotation in *every* frame. However, this makes it frame-rate independent, which is very important for replaying it at the same speed as recording it! (The difference in 'missing frames' cannot be perceived). So if you are using your own files, that are not created using *CSVRecorder*, make sure that you record the movement within *FixedUpdate*!

<p align="right">(<a href="#readme-top">back to top</a>)</p>

#### *Texture grab function*
In the following the different parts contributing to the replay function will be listed.
* *visu-tools > materials > Texture Grab Materials* : Contains one material that uses the Texture Grab shader.
* *visu-tools > Scripts > Texture Grab Scripts*: Contains one script called *TextureGrabber* that can save the motion vector texture as well as the depth texture to a png file.
* *visu-tools > Shader > Visualization Shader* : Contains one shader file. That shader has one subshader and two passes. One pass returns the motion vector texture, the other pass returns the depth texture.

For the **basic usage** the *TextureGrabber* file has to be used as follows. <br />

1. In the hierarchy click on the camera object from which you want the textures.
2. In the inspector go to *Add Component* and type *TextureGrabber*. Add the *TextureGRabber* C# script to your camera.
3. In the inspector part for the script the material should already be moved in there (if not, please do so); the camera should be empty. In this empty camera field move your camera object (the same object where you added the script as a component).
4. You're all set up! You can now control which texture gets saved as an image (.png) by (un-)checking the corresponding box in the inspector part for the script.

**Important additions**: 
* The images get saved to *Application.persistentDataPath/DepthGrab* and *Application.persistentDataPath/MotionGrab* if no path is provided in the *File Path* slot in the inspector. Otherwise the get saved to *File Path/DepthGrab* and *File Path/MotionGrab*.
* For images the show the depth texture the nameing convention is as follows: *depth_cam.stereoActiveEye.ToString().ToLower()_Time.frameCount_Time.delta_Time*. For images the show the motion vectors texture the naming convention is as follows: *motion_cam.stereoActiveEye.ToString().ToLower()_Time.frameCount_Time.delta_Time*. <br /> In the case the xr is not active *cam.stereoActiveEye.ToString().ToLower()* resolves to *mono*. In the case that xr is active and multi pass is being used *cam.stereoActiveEye.ToString().ToLower()* resolves to *left* or *right*; so two images are saved for very frame (one for each eye). In the case that xr is active and single pass instanced is being used *cam.stereoActiveEye.ToString().ToLower()* resolves to *left*; so only the image for the left eye is saved for every frame (because single pass instanced rendering is weird...).
* In the motion vectors images the red channel contains the movement in x-direction and the green channel contains the movement in the y-direction. The original rendertexture values can range from $-1$ to $1$. Both values have been divided by *Time.delta_Time*, so they are not nearly $0$; for reconstructing purposes of the original values *Time.delta_Time* is contained in the file name. If the image contains another value range ($0-255$) and it is important for you to have the original range, you have to scale it back into the original range.
* In the depth texture images each color channel contains the same value. The original rendertexture values can range from $0$ to $1$ and are distributed linearly. $0$ represents the near plane, $1$ the far plane. If the image contains another value range ($0-255$) and it is important for you to have the original range, you have to scale it back into the original range.

<!-- TECHNICAL BACKGROUND -->
## Technical background

This section tries to (at least partially) explain how the different visualization tools work in theory. It will also cover some of the implementation details and things to be aware of when using the *visu-tool package* in your own project.
/TODO au bio stuff in read me? is eigentlich scho zu lang f√ºr ne read me und gheh√∂rt au ned wirklich zum technischne zeug dazu, also propbably ned

### Interlude
Before thinking about how an *individual* visualization tool works, one has to think about how they work *in general*. As explained here <a href="#about-the-project">About The Project</a>, the purpose of the visualization tools is to extract some kind of "meta data" from what a participant perceives during a VR-navigation-experiment. Broadly speaking, what they perceive is a rapid sequence of frames, where each frame itself can be interpreted as an image. This image shows part of the virtual world as seen through the virtual eyes/virtual camera of the participant. As the participant moves those eyes/this camera the image will change as it shows a different part of the virtual world. Because the changing of frames is happening at a very high speed (for example 400 frames per second) the participant cannot distinguish between the different frames and instead perceives it as a continuous stream of information that simulates movement. <br />
In order to now visualize the "meta data" in this stream, one starts by simply saving the movement information (position + rotation at a frame x) of the participant and replaying it with the same frame-rate as the participant experienced. This replay is what will now be manipulated. More precisely, each frame will be seen as an image on which an image-processing effect will be applied before it gets shown. In Unity this is done by using post-processing shaders that effect the final render image output of the camera by changing every pixel color within a fragment shader. <br />
So, essentially, one has to understand what an image is in this context and how it can be manipulated.

#### *What is an image*
In this context an image is one single frame that is contained within a $M \times N  \times 3$ dimensional matrix where $M$ is the height of the frame and $N$ is the width of the frame. The $3$ represents the three different RGB-color channels which contain a value form 0 to 255 (or 0 to 1 in Unity; keyword: normalization). So, for example, the value at $(j,k,0) \in M \times N \times 3$ represents the red color value of the pixel at height $j$ and width $k$. <br />
Applying an image processing effect now results in manipulating each RGB value for every pixel ( manipulating all $(j,k,i) \in M \times N \times 3$ ). This is simply done by using  matrix operations, one very important matrix operation in this case is *convolution* (more on that later).

/TODO hier wahrschienlich au frequenzen erw√§hnen, damit des unten mehr Sinn ergibt
/TODO Fourier??????????

<p align="right">(<a href="#readme-top">back to top</a>)</p>

### Linear filters
Linear filters are image pre-processing effects in which the final value of a pixel is given by a linear combination of the value of the pixel itself and of the values of the pixel in its neighborhood $W$. <br />
This calculation is realized by *convolution*. During convolution a small, square matrix with an odd height/width (e.g. $5 \times 5$, $9 \times 9$,...), a so called *kernel*, is  slid over the image matrix. Every entry of this kernel represents a weight *w_i* with which the value of the image pixel underneath the kernel gets multiplied. After every image pixel value underneath the kernel got multiplied with the corresponding weight, those values get summed up. This sum is now the final value of the image pixel that is positioned underneath the kernels middle. <br />
When dealing with colored images, this process is separately done for every color channel. So the final red/green/blue value of every pixel is determined independently of the other two colors. 

/TODO Bild f√ºr conv erkl√§rung einf√ºgen?


#### *Gaussian blur*
A Gaussian blur is a way of applying a low-pass filter to an image. A low-pass filter "smoothes" the image by keeping its low frequencies and discarding its high frequencies. Depending on how low/high a frequency needs to be in order to count as a low/high frequency, the image will appear more or less smooth/blurry; The more is discarded, the blurry the image will appear. <br />
This "discarding/keeping decision" can be realized by doing a convolution on each RGB-channel of the image. So the final red/green/blue value of a pixel $(j,k)$ is the result of the current red/green/blue pixel value added to the values of the pixel in its neighborhood $W$, where each of those values in weighted by a kernel. The bigger the kernel the bigger the neighborhood $W$. 

The important part now is how the kernel weights $w_i$ are designed. Getting rid of high frequencies can be seen as decreasing the disparity between the different pixel values; this can simply be realized by averaging over them. So a $3 \times 3$ kernel would look like this:
```math
\frac{1}{9} \cdot \begin{bmatrix}
	1 & 1 & 1 \\
	1 & 1 & 1 \\
	1 & 1 & 1 
\end{bmatrix} 
```
So $w_i=\frac{1}{9} \\ \forall i\in\[0..8\]$. <br />
As the size of such an averaging kernel increases, the neighborhood $W$ increases and the individual kernel weights decrease. So more pixel are involved in the averging step which makes the color transition smoother; hence the image appears more blurry. <br />
However, using such an averaging kernel lets the final image appear a bit "boxy"; hence why a low-pass filter that is implemented in such a fashion is referred to as *Box blur*. <br />
The effect of this filter can be seen here: <a href="#example-images">Example images</a> 

/TODO evtl doch Fourier ansprechen, damit box mittels transformation in frquenzbereich erkl√§rt werden kann? Zu komplex?

In order to have less of a "boxy" look to the final image, the above kernel can slightly be adjusted. Instead of giving each pixel in $W$ the same weight, the weight will be dependent on the distance of each pixel $(j,k) \in W$ to the middle pixel in $W$. The further away a pixel, the smaller its weight. So a $3 \times 3$ kernel might look like this:
```math
\frac{1}{16} \cdot \begin{bmatrix}
	1 & 2 & 1 \\
	2 & 4 & 2 \\
	1 & 2 & 1 
\end{bmatrix} 
```
More elaborately, the weights $w_i$ are given by the product of two discrete Gaussian functions (hence Gaussian blur), one per image dimension:
```math
G(x,y) = \frac{1}{2 \pi \sigma ^2} \exp ^{-\frac{x^2 + y^2}{2 \sigma ^2}}
```
Here $x$ is the distance of the currently looked at pixel from the center pixel on the horizontal axis, $y$ is this distance on the vertical axis and $\sigma$ is the standard deviation of the Gaussian distribution. <br />

/TODO vllt mehr erkl√§ren warum Einfach produkt (seperierbarkeit!)

This can further be simplified, because the discrete Gaussian function can be approximated by the binomial distribution. So in order to get the correct kernel weights it is enough to simply look at Pascals triangle. <br />
Each row in Pascals triangle can be interpreted as a one-dimensional kernel that weights the pixel closer to the center more that those farther away. For example the second row (counting starts at $0$!) would yield the following kernel
```math
\begin{bmatrix}
	1 & 2 & 1 
\end{bmatrix} 
```
Normalizing these values yields
```math
\frac{1}{4} \cdot  \begin{bmatrix}
	1 & 2 & 1 
\end{bmatrix} 
```
So, in general, a one-dimensional Gaussian kernel can be obtained through 
```math
\frac{1}{2^n} \cdot  \begin{bmatrix}
	PascalRow(n,0) & PascalRow(n,1) & ... & PascalRow(n,n) 
\end{bmatrix} 
```
where $PascalRow(n,x)$ refers to the $x$-th value of the $n$-th row in Pascals triangle (counting starts at $0$ for both $x$ and $n$). <br />
In order to get a two-dimensional kernel, the kernel simply gets multiplied with its transpose; this works due to the separability of the two-dimensional Gaussian function. In the case of a $3 \times 3$ kernel that yields
```math
\frac{1}{4}  \cdot  \begin{bmatrix}
	1 & 2 & 1 
\end{bmatrix} \cdot \frac{1}{4}  \cdot  \begin{bmatrix}
	1 \\ 2 \\ 1 
\end{bmatrix}  = \frac{1}{16} \cdot \begin{bmatrix}
	1 & 2 & 1 \\
	2 & 4 & 2 \\
	1 & 2 & 1 
\end{bmatrix} 

```
which is exactly the kernel from above! <br />
The effect of this filter can be seen here: <a href="#example-images">Example images</a> 

#####  *Implementation remarks*
1. For efficiency reasons the separability of the kernel is being used. In the first shader pass a horizontal Gaussian blur is applied to the image, this gets saved as an intermediate result. On this intermediate result a vertical Gaussian blur is applied, resulting in a final output-image that is blurred horizontally and vertically.
2. For efficiency reasons the kernel weights are determined a little differently than described above. For example if the kernel is supposed to have dimensions $5 \times 5$, the $9$-th row of the Pascal triangle is being picked instead of the $5$-th row. Then the two most left and the two most rights values of this row are discarded, leaving the middle $5$ values of the $9$-th row. The reasoning behind this is that otherwise the outermost weights are quite small, so the pixel values underneath them do not contribute a lot to the final result; however, you still have to look up the image pixel value for each of them, which is the costly operation. So designing the kernel with a "higher" row and discarding values leads to bigger weights and thus more blur effect with comparably less pixel value look-up operations. <br />
Additionally Linear sampling is being used in order to reduce the look-up operations. 

/TODO maybe Linear sampling erkl√§ren

3. If you select the *Gaussian blur* shader option in the *ControlShader* script you can get the additional option to change the kernel size. The bigger this value, the stronger the effect. The minimum value is $5$, the maximum value is $127$ and the default value is $9$. Only odd values change the effect. Only integer values are possible.

<p align="right">(<a href="#readme-top">back to top</a>)</p>

#### *High-pass filter*
A high-pass filter is basically the inverse of a low-pass filter. Instead of keeping the images low frequencies and discarding its high frequencies, a high-pass filter discards the images low frequencies and keeps its high frequencies.  This strengthens the disparity between the pixel values and erases area information. Same as for the low-pass filter: The more is discarded, the stronger this effect. <br />
This "discarding/keeping decision" can again be realized by doing a convolution on each RGB-channel of the image. 

The kernel weights $w_i$ are chosen quite simply. As the high-pass filter is the inverse operation of the low-pass filter, the kernels for the low-pass filter can just be inverted. <br />
For the $3 \times 3$ Box blur kernel this yields
```math
\begin{bmatrix}
	0 & 0 & 0 \\
	0 & 1 & 0 \\
	0 & 0 & 0 
\end{bmatrix} - \frac{1}{9} \cdot \begin{bmatrix}
	1 & 1 & 1 \\
	1 & 1 & 1 \\
	1 & 1 & 1 
\end{bmatrix}  = \frac{1}{9} \cdot  \begin{bmatrix}
	-1 & -1 & -1 \\
	-1 & 8 & -1 \\
	-1 & -1 & -1 
\end{bmatrix} 
```
For the $3 \times 3$ Gaussian blur kernel this yields
```math
\begin{bmatrix}
	0 & 0 & 0 \\
	0 & 1 & 0 \\
	0 & 0 & 0 
\end{bmatrix} - \frac{1}{16} \cdot \begin{bmatrix}
	1 & 2 & 1 \\
	2 & 4 & 2 \\
	1 & 2 & 1 
\end{bmatrix} 
= \frac{1}{16} \cdot  \begin{bmatrix}
	-1 & -2 & -1 \\
	-2 & 12 & -2 \\
	-1 & -2 & -1 
\end{bmatrix} 
```

#####  *Implementation remarks*
1. For efficiency reasons the high-pass filter is not implemented using convolution with a high-pass filter kernel. Instead of doing convolution with a high-pass filter kernel, convolution is done with a low-pass filter kernel (the implementation is the same efficient implementation as mentioned above in the <a href="#gaussian-blur">Gaussian blur</a> section). The result of this convolution is saved as an intermediate result. Afterwards, in the high-pass filter shader pass, for every pixel the final color is calculate. This is done be simply subtracting the color of the low-pass filtered intermediate result from the original color. Trivially, this is the same as doing a convolution with a high-pass filter kernel.
3. If you select the *High-pass* shader option in the *ControlShader* script you can get the additional option to change the kernel size. The bigger this value, the stronger the effect. The minimum value is $5$, the maximum value is $127$ and the default value is $9$. Only odd values change the effect. Only integer values are possible.

#### *Sharpening*
Sharpening an image basically means to enhance the edges contained within an image. So the images high frequencies need to exaggerated while the images low frequencies stay the same. In contrast to a low-pass or high-pass filter no frequencies are discarded, only added. <br />
This adding of high frequencies can be realized by doing a convolution on each RGB-channel of the image. 

The kernel weights $w_i$ are again chosen quite simply. Since all that has to be done is adding $x$ times the high frequencies to the original image, a $3 \times 3$ Gaussian kernel looks as follows
```math
\begin{bmatrix}
	0 & 0 & 0 \\
	0 & 1 & 0 \\
	0 & 0 & 0 
\end{bmatrix}  + x \cdot \left(
\begin{bmatrix}
	0 & 0 & 0 \\
	0 & 1 & 0 \\
	0 & 0 & 0 
\end{bmatrix} - \frac{1}{16} \cdot \begin{bmatrix}
	1 & 2 & 1 \\
	2 & 4 & 2 \\
	1 & 2 & 1 
\end{bmatrix}  \right)
= \frac{1}{16} \cdot  \begin{bmatrix}
	-x & -2x & -x \\
	-2x & 13x & -2x \\
	-x & -2x & -x 
\end{bmatrix} 
```
where $x$ determines how much of the images high frequencies should be added to the original image. The higher $x$ the stronger the sharpening effect. <br />
The effect of this filter can be seen here: <a href="#example-images">Example images</a> 

#####  *Implementation remarks*
1. If you select the *Sharpening* shader option in the *ControlShader* script you can get the additional option to change the kernel size. The bigger this value, the stronger the effect. The minimum value is $5$, the maximum value is $127$ and the default value is $9$. Only odd values change the effect. Only integer values are possible.
2. The scaling factor $x$ is set to $0.85$ and cannot be controlled via the inspector. If you want to be able to control this value, you have to include it into the inspector yourself.

#### *Radial blur*
As the name suggest a radial blur is a kind of a low-pass filter. So it "smoothes" the image by keeping its low frequencies and discarding its high frequencies. There are however some difference to a Box blur or a Gaussian blur. <br />
For a Box blur or a Gaussian blur the image gets smoothed along the horizontal axis by a kernel that for example looks like this ( $3 \times 3$ one-dimensional Gaussian kernel)
```math
\frac{1}{4} \cdot  \begin{bmatrix}
	1 & 2 & 1 
\end{bmatrix} 
```
and the image gets smoothed along the vertical axis by a kernel that for example looks like this ( $3 \times 3$ one-dimensional Gaussian kernel)
```math
\frac{1}{4} \cdot  \begin{bmatrix}
	1 \\ 2 \\ 1 
\end{bmatrix} 
```
For a radial blur the image gets smoothed along another axis/vector that is dependent on the currently looked at pixel and the *origin of the blur*. The *origin of the blur* refers to a point in the image that stays unaffected by the filter (i.e. it does not get blurred).  The farther away a pixel from this origin, the more it gets blurred. This results in an effect that can be seen in <a href="#example-images">Example images</a>; once with the origin being at the center of the image and once with the origin being off-center.

Mathematically the vector that determines the "smoothing-axis" is given by 
```math
((j,k) - (j_{origin}, k_{origin}))^T = \begin{bmatrix}
	j \\ k 
\end{bmatrix}  - \begin{bmatrix}
	j_{origin} \\ k_{origin}
\end{bmatrix}  =  \begin{bmatrix}
	j-j_{origin} \\ k-k_{origin}
\end{bmatrix}
```
where $(j,k)$ refers to a pixel (in on color layer) of image and $(j_{origin}, k_{origin})$ refers to the origin of the blur.

In order to get the final color of a pixel $(j,k)$, its neighbors along this axis are being looked at. More concrete, these neighbors are
```math
\pm \frac{n-1}{2} \cdot \begin{bmatrix}
	j-j_{origin} \\ k-k_{origin}
\end{bmatrix}
```
where $n$ determines how many pixel (including $(j,k)$ ) are being looked at; the size of the neighborhood $W$. <br />
As for the Gaussian blur or the Box blur, the value of each pixel in $W$ gets weighted by a weight $w_i$ and afterwards their sum is being set as the final color value of $(j,k)$. In the case of $|W|=3$, the weights could be given by the following Gaussian kernel
```math
\frac{1}{4} \cdot  \begin{bmatrix}
	1 & 2 & 1 
\end{bmatrix} 
```

The way how $W$ is defined clearly shows why pixel farther away from the origin of the blur are more effected by the blurring than pixel closer to the origin of the blur. <br />
The farther away a pixel from the origin, the bigger their in-between distance; hence the magnitude of 
```math  
\begin{bmatrix}
	j-j_{origin} \\ k-k_{origin}
\end{bmatrix}
```
gets bigger as well. <br />
Thus using this unnormalized(!) vector in determining $W$ leads to the individual pixel in $W$ being farther apart from each other as $(j,k)$ gets farther away from the origin of the blur. Resulting in more high image frequencies being discarded for farther away pixel and less high image frequencies being discarded for closer pixel. As the distance between the pixel in $W$ grows linearly with the distance of $(j,k)$ to the origin, the blur effect is linear as well.

#####  *Implementation remarks*
1. If you select the *Radial Blur* shader option in the *ControlShader* script you can get the additional option to change the kernel size. The bigger this value, the stronger the effect. The minimum value is $5$, the maximum value is $127$ and the default value is $9$. Only odd values change the effect. Only integer values are possible.
2. If you select the *Radial Blur* shader option in the *ControlShader* script you can get the additional option to change the origin of the blur on the horizontal and on the vertical axis. Both values range from $0$ to $1$, $(0,0)$ representing the bottom left corner and $(1,1)$ representing the top right corner. The default is $(0.5, 0.5)$. If you are using xr this origin can be determined for each eye independently.
3. If you select the *Radial Blur* shader option in the *ControlShader* script you can get the additional option to change the scale of the radial blur. This value scales the vector between each pixel and the origin of the blur; hence the bigger this value, the stronger the effect. The minimum value is $0$, the maximum value is $10$ and the default value is $5$.

#### *Radial blur with desaturation*
This filter is an extension of the <a href="#radial-blur">Radial blur</a> filter described above. As such the image gets blurred from an origin of blur towards the images edges; the farther away a pixel from the origin, the blurrier it appears. Additionally each pixel's color saturation is also dependent on the distance between $(j,k)$ and $(j_{origin},k_{origin})$; the farther away a pixel from the origin, the less it is saturated. This results in the image only containing gray values at the points furthest away from  $(j_{origin},k_{origin})$ and fully saturated values at $(j_{origin},k_{origin})$. An example of this filter can be seen here:  <a href="#example-images">Example images</a>.

The way the desaturation part is calculated is pretty straight forwards. <br />
First the maximal distance between the origin of the blur and any image pixel gets calculated. As the image is rectangular, no matter where the origin is positioned, the maximal distance will always be achieved with a corner pixel (i.e. $(0,0), (0,1), (1,0), (1,1) $). Thus
```math  
maxDist =  \left \lVert \max \left \{ 
\begin{bmatrix}
	0-j_{origin} \\ 0-k_{origin}
\end{bmatrix},
\begin{bmatrix}
	0-j_{origin} \\ 1-k_{origin}
\end{bmatrix},
\begin{bmatrix}
	1-j_{origin} \\ 0-k_{origin}
\end{bmatrix},
\begin{bmatrix}
	1-j_{origin} \\ 1-k_{origin}
\end{bmatrix}
\right \} \right \rVert
```
This value is obviously the same for every pixel. 

As a second step a scale value gets calculated for each individual pixel. This value determines how far a pixel is positioned from the origin of the blur relative to the maximal distance. 
```math  
scale = \frac{\left \lVert \begin{bmatrix}
		j-j_{origin} \\ k-k_{origin}
	\end{bmatrix} \right \rVert}{maxDist} 
```

Finally, the color for each pixel can be determined by a linear interpolation between the pixels intermediate color (i.e. after applying the radial blur on it) and its grayscale intermediate color. Thus
```math  
(j,k) = lerp[(j,k)', gray((j,k)'), scale] = (j,k)' + scale \cdot [gray((j,k)') - (j,k)']
```
where $(j,k)'$ refers to the pixels color after the radial blur and  $gray((j,k)')$ refers to the grayscale value of the color after the radial blur. More precisely, $gray((j,k)')$ is defined as
```math  
gray((j,k)') =  0.299 \cdot (j,k)'.r + 0.587 \cdot (j,k)'.g + 0.114 \cdot (j,k)'.b;
```
where $(j,k)'.r$ is the red channel value of $(j,k)'$ (analogous for the blue and green channel). <br />
If the final color of $(j,k)$ is determined separately for each color channel, in the $lerp$-function $(j,k)'$ only refers to that color channels value and $gray((j,k)')$ is the value defined above. If the final color of $(j,k)$ is determined for all color channels at once, in the $lerp$-function $(j,k)'$ refers to $[(j,k)'.r, (j,k)'.g, (j,k)'.b]$ and $gray((j,k)')$ is defined as $[gray((j,k)'), gray((j,k)'), gray((j,k)')]$ (so the same value for each color channel).

From this definition follows that the pixels furthest away from the origin of the blur are completely desaturated.
```math  
scale = \frac{\left \lVert \begin{bmatrix}
		j-j_{origin} \\ k-k_{origin}
	\end{bmatrix} \right \rVert}{maxDist}  = \frac{maxDist}{maxDist} = 1
```
```math  
(j,k) = lerp[(j,k)', gray((j,k)'), 1] = (j,k)' + 1 \cdot [gray((j,k)') - (j,k)'] = (j,k)' - (j,k)' + gray((j,k)') = gray((j,k)')
```
It also follows that the origin of the blur is not desaturated at all
```math  
scale = \frac{\left \lVert \begin{bmatrix}
		j_{origin}-j_{origin} \\ k_{origin}-k_{origin}
	\end{bmatrix} \right \rVert}{maxDist}  = \frac{0}{maxDist} = 0
```
```math  
(j,k) = lerp[(j,k)', gray((j,k)'), 0] = (j,k)' + 0 \cdot [gray((j,k)') - (j,k)'] = (j,k)' 
```
As the distance between each image pixel $(j,k)$ and the origin of the blur grows linearly, the desaturation effect is linear as well.

#####  *Implementation remarks*
1. If you select the *Radial Blur Desat* shader option in the *ControlShader* script you can get the additional option to change the kernel size. The bigger this value, the stronger the effect.
